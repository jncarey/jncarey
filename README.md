<h1>Welcome!<br/></h1>
I'm Jeffrey, an accomplished research scientist with extensive wet lab experience in molecular biology, genetics, microbiology, and synthetic biology. I'm very interested in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data science. This page showcases some of the code I've written for work, for practice, and for fun!
